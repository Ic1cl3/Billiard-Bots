The core game my simplfied Godot version of Jonas Tyroller's game Broink: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kF7htOq0B3k

The overall concept is inspired by Terminal: https://terminal.c1games.com/

The game is simple. Each player is a ball. You can move around and knock yourself into your opponnent. The last person to fall out of the arena wins. On paper, there isn't much to it. The catch is that you aren't the one playing the game. You'll need to code your own bot to do so for you.

I will create templates for anyone to create their own bot using python, although for now you will need to do the heavy lifting to create a bot in any other language.

The game will be available on my website (https://ic1cl3.github.io/icicle/) when it is finished, although at any point you can get the game from this repo if you know Godot, which should also help you create your own library for a bot in a language other than python if you are struggeling to do so with the provided python material.
